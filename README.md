<b>Problem Statement:</b>

The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns in work-from-home preferences and leave-taking behavior among employees over a three-month period. The data set includes attendance records for 50+ employees, captured in Excel spreadsheets. The data needs to be transformed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis. The goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding the preferred weekdays for work-from-home and identify any recurring leave patterns, which can help optimize resource allocation and improve workforce planning.

<b>The analysis will focus on:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Data Transformation and Cleaning:</b> Standardizing attendance records, handling missing or inconsistent entries, and formatting data for seamless analysis.</li>

<li><b>Work-from-Home Preferences: </b>Determining the most popular weekdays for work-from-home across the employee base.</li>

<li><b>Leave Patterns: </b>Identifying trends in leave-taking, including frequency, preferred days, and potential correlations with work-from-home days.</li>

<li><b>Insights and Recommendations: </b>Providing actionable insights based on the analysis to assist in strategic decision-making related to remote work policies and resource </li>management.
</ol>
